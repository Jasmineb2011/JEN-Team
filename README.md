3. To answer visualley impaired clients we used negative CSS styling,
such as: background, color of text, font size, font etc that are easily visible and bold enough. :eyes:

4. To answer blind clients, we used [ChromeVOX](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromevox/kgejglhpjiefppelpmljglcjbhoiplfn?hl=en) screen reader so the page will be easily read tab by tab. :ear:

6. For the contact form we used the [FORMSPREE](https://formspree.io/) server. So we will be able to receive the sent messages from the page and also to be able to return to the sender properly.

7. We also chose big fonts to make it clear and clean  :sunglasses:

8. To answer client story with Javascript disabled - we didn't use Javascript at all . üôÖ

9. We used anchors in our navigation bar, so th eclient can easily move to the spesific data he seeks. üîç

10. The most challenging thing in  working on the application was making all the circulation of pushing branches to master in Github. but fortunately we got used to it . :grinning:
